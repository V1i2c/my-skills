# Continuous Agent Loop

Canonical workflow for continuous autonomous agent loops with quality gates, evaluations, and recovery controls.

## Loop Selection Flow

```text
Start
  |
  +-- Need strict CI/PR control? -- yes --> continuous-pr
  |
  +-- Need RFC decomposition? -- yes --> rfc-dag
  |
  +-- Need exploratory parallel generation? -- yes --> infinite
  |
  +-- default --> sequential
```

## Combined Pattern

Recommended production stack:
1. RFC decomposition (`ralphinho-rfc-pipeline`)
2. quality gates (`verification-loop` + `coding-standards`)
3. eval loop (`eval-harness`)
4. session persistence (`context-and-decisions`)

## Failure Modes

- loop churn without measurable progress
- repeated retries with same root cause
- merge queue stalls
- cost drift from unbounded escalation

## Recovery

- freeze loop
- run a harness audit
- reduce scope to failing unit
- replay with explicit acceptance criteria
